To use this template, do the following:

1. Download this GitHub project (either git clone, or download as a ZIP)
2. Open up the Godot Game Engine
3. Select "Import", then navigate to the project.godot file located inside of this project.

If you want to use some of the files from this project, or add it to another project, it's pretty simple.
Follow the same steps, but instead of importing the project.godot, just move the files you want to use into your existing Godot project.
NOTE: This method is not reccomended, as if Scripts or Scenes are stored differently, something could crash.
